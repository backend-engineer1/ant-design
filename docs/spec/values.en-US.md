For designers of Ant Design and designers who used Ant Design for product design, it provides the criteria for evaluation. At the same time, it inspires and inspires design principles and design patterns to provide guidance and general solutions to specific design issues

About Design Values, Ant Design has something different:

## Nature

As a part of nature, it will have deep influence on user behavior, and designers should draw inspiration from it and apply it to current design work. We have done some exploration and will pursue "nature" as our future direction.

- In the perception and cognition, the visual system plays the most important role. By refining the objective laws in nature and applying it to the interface design, a more layered product experience is created. At the same time, hearing systems and tactile systems are added timely, Create more dimensions, more real product experience. See visual language.
- In the course of behavior, a series of methods such as behavior analysis, artificial intelligence and sensors are used to assist users to make effective decisions and reduce extra operations of users, so as to save users' mental and physical resources and make human-computer interaction more natural.

The "designer" needs to make better design decisions and give the R & D team a high-definition, low-entropy R & D status. At the same time, different designers, based on a complete understanding of the business requirements, will have the same design output that is consistent with the current business characteristics based on the Ant Design system.

- **Keep restraint:** you can do it, but you know you do not have to do it. Designers should focus on the valuable product features polished, and use minimal design elements to express. As Antoine de St.Exupery said: Perfection is not to be added, but rather that there is no excuse to be removed, and nothing is done.
- **The object-oriented method:** Explore design rules and abstract them into "objects" to enhance the flexibility and maintainability of interface design while reducing "designer's" subjective interference and reducing system uncertainty. For example: color value conversion, spacing typesetting.
- **Modular Design:** Packaging complex or recurring parts locally, providing limited interfaces to interact with other modules, ultimately reducing overall system complexity, resulting in increased reliability and maintainability. Designers can use existing components, templates or abstract their own reusable components, templates, save unnecessary design and maintain system consistency, so that "designers" to focus on creativity where most needed.
