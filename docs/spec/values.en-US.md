Ant Design provides a practical evaluation of better design for both designers of Ant Design and designers who are using it. At the same time, it build a foundation for design principles and design patterns which could provide guideline and general solutions for specified design goal.

Here is our design values:

## Nature

As a part of nature, it will have deep influence on user behavior, and designers should draw inspiration from it and apply it to our daily design work. We have started exploring and will pursue nature as our future direction.

- The visual system plays the most important role in human perception and cognition. By refining the objective laws in nature and applying it to the interface design, a more layered product experience is created. In addition, hearing systems or tactile systems could be added in future to bring more dimensions and more real product experience. See visual language.
- In the real product design, a series of methods such as behavior analysis, artificial intelligence and sensors could be applied to assist users to make effective decisions and reduce extra operations of users, so as to save users' mental and physical resources and make human-computer interaction more natural.

## Determinacy

The "designer" needs to make better design decisions and give the R&D team a high-definition, low-entropy R & D status. At the same time, different designers, based on a complete understanding of the business requirements, will have the same design output that is consistent with the current business characteristics based on the Ant Design system.

- **Keep restraint:** you can do it, but you know you do not have to do it. Designers should focus on the valuable product features polished, and use minimal design elements to express. As Antoine de St.Exupery said: Perfection is not to be added, but rather that there is no excuse to be removed, and nothing is done.
- **Object-oriented:** Explore design rules and abstract them as "objects" to enhance the flexibility and maintainability of user interface design while reducing "designer's" subjective interference and reducing system uncertainty. For example: color value conversion, spacing typesetting.
- **Modular:** Packaging complex or recurring parts locally, providing limited interfaces to interact with other modules, ultimately reducing overall system complexity, resulting in increased reliability and maintainability. Designers can use existing components, templates or abstract their own reusable components, templates, save unnecessary design and maintain system consistency, so that "designers" to focus on creativity where most needed.
