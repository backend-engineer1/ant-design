title: Customize Theme
---

Ant Design allows you to customize our design tokens to satisfy UI diversity from business or brand requirements, including primary color, border radius, border color, etc.

In version 5.0, we provide a new way to customize themes. Different from the less and CSS variables of the 4.x version, with CSS-in-JS, the ability of theming has also been enhanced, including but not limited to:

1. Switching theme dynamically；
2. Multiple themes；
3. Customizing theme variables for some component；
4. ...

## Customize theme with `ConfigProvider`

In version 5.0 we call the smallest element that affects the theme **Design Token**. By modifying the Design Token, we can present various themes or components.

### Customize Design Token

You can pass `theme` to ConfigProvider to customize theme. After migrate to V5, theme of V5 will be applied by default. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import { Button, ConfigProvider } from 'antd';
import React from 'react';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ConfigProvider
    theme={{
      token: {
        colorPrimary: '#00b96b',
      },
    }}
  >
    <Button />
  </ConfigProvider>
);

export default App;
```

You will get a theme with primary color <ColorChunk color="#00b96b" /></ColorChunk>. And we can see the change in Button:

### Use Preset Algorithms

Themes with different styles can be quickly generated by modifying `algorithm`. Ant Design 5.0 provides three sets of preset algorithms by default, which are default algorithm `theme.defaultAlgorithm`, dark algorithm `theme.darkAlgorithm` and compact algorithm `theme.compactAlgorithm`. You can switch algorithms by modifying the `algorithm` property of `theme` in ConfigProvider.

```tsx
import { Button, ConfigProvider, theme } from 'antd';
import React from 'react';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ConfigProvider
    theme={{
      algorithm: theme.darkAlgorithm,
    }}
  >
    <Button />
  </ConfigProvider>
);

export default App;
```

### Customize Component Token

In addition to Design Token, each component will also have its own Component Token to achieve style customization capabilities for components, and different components will not affect each other. Similarly, other Design Token of components can also be overridden in this way.

```tsx
import { Checkbox, ConfigProvider, Radio } from 'antd';
import React from 'react';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ConfigProvider
    theme={{
      components: {
        Radio: {
          colorPrimary: '#00b96b',
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    <Radio>Radio</Radio>
    <Checkbox>Checkbox</Checkbox>
  </ConfigProvider>
);

export default App;
```

In this way, we changed the primary color of Radio to <ColorChunk color="#00b96b" /></ColorChunk>, and Checkbox is not affected.

> Notice: `ConfigProvider` will not take effect on static methods such as `message.xxx`, `Modal.xxx`, `notification.xxx`, because in these methods, antd will dynamically create new ones through `ReactDOM.render` React entities. Its context is not the same as the context of the current code, so context information cannot be obtained. When you need context information (such as the content configured by ConfigProvider), you can use the `Modal.useModal` method to return the modal entity and the contextHolder node. Just insert it where you need to get the context, or you can use [App Component](/components/app) to simplify the problem of usingModal and other methods that need to manually implant the contextHolder.

## Other Ways to Use Dynamic Themes

### Switch Themes Dynamically

In v5, dynamically switching themes is very simple for users, you can dynamically switch themes at any time through the `theme` property of `ConfigProvider` without any additional configuration.

### Local Theme

By nesting `ConfigProvider` you can apply local theme to some parts of your page. Design Tokens that have not been changed in the child theme will inherit the parent theme.

```tsx
import { Button, ConfigProvider } from 'antd';
import React from 'react';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ConfigProvider
    theme={{
      token: {
        colorPrimary: '#1677ff',
      },
    }}
  >
    <Button />
    <ConfigProvider
      theme={{
        token: {
          colorPrimary: '#1890ff',
        },
      }}
    >
      <Button />
    </ConfigProvider>
  </ConfigProvider>
);

export default App;
```

### Consume Design Token

If you want to consume the Design Token under the current theme, we provide `useToken` hook to get Design Token.

```tsx
import { Button, theme } from 'antd';
import React from 'react';

const { useToken } = theme;

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const { token } = useToken();

  return <Button style={{ backgroundColor: token.colorPrimary }}>Button</Button>;
};

export default App;
```

### Static consume (e.g. less)

When you need token out of React life cycle, you can use static function to get them:

```jsx
import { theme } from 'antd';

const { defaultAlgorithm, defaultSeed } = theme;

const mapToken = defaultAlgorithm(defaultSeed);
```

If you want to use in preprocess style framework like less, use less-loader for injection:

```jsx
{
  loader: "less-loader",
  options: {
    lessOptions: {
      modifyVars: mapToken,
    },
  },
}
```

Compatible package provide convert function to transform to v4 less variable. Read [this](/docs/react/migration-v5) for detail.

## Advanced

In Design Token, we provide a three-layer structure that is more suitable for the design, and disassemble the Design Token into three parts: Seed Token, Map Token and Alias Token. These three groups of Tokens are not simple groupings, but a three-layer derivation relationship. Map Tokens are derived from Seed Tokens, and Alias Tokens are derived from Map Tokens. In most cases, using Seed Tokens is sufficient for custom themes. But if you need a higher degree of theme customization, you need to understand the life cycle of Design Token in antd.

### Life Cycle of Design Token

### Seed Token

Seed Token means the origin of all design intent. For example, we can change the theme color by changing `colorPrimary`, and the algorithm inside antd will automatically calculate and apply a series of corresponding colors according to the Seed Token:

```tsx
const theme = {
  token: {
    colorPrimary: '#1890ff',
  },
};
```

### Map Token

Map Token is a gradient variable derived from Seed. It is recommended to implement custom Map Token through `theme.algorithm`, which can ensure the gradient relationship between Map Tokens. It can also be overridden by `theme.token` to modify the value of some map tokens individually.

```tsx
const theme = {
  token: {
    colorPrimaryBg: '#e6f7ff',
  },
};
```

### Alias Token

Alias Token is used to control the style of some common components in batches, which is basically a Map Token alias, or a specially processed Map Token.

```tsx
const theme = {
  token: {
    colorLink: '#1890ff',
  },
};
```

### Algorithm

The basic algorithm is used to expand the Seed Token into a Map Token, such as calculating a gradient color palette from a basic color, or calculating rounded corners of various sizes from a basic rounded corner. Algorithms can be used alone or in any combination, for example, dark and compact algorithms can be combined to get a dark and compact theme.

```tsx
import { theme } from 'antd';

const { darkAlgorithm, compactAlgorithm } = theme;

const theme = {
  algorithm: [darkAlgorithm, compactAlgorithm],
};
```

### Legacy Browser Compatible

Please ref to [CSS Compatible](/docs/react/compatible-style).

### Server Side Render (SSR)

Use `@ant-design/cssinjs` to extract style:

```tsx
import { createCache, extractStyle, StyleProvider } from '@ant-design/cssinjs';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

export default () => {
  // SSR Render
  const cache = createCache();

  const html = renderToString(
    <StyleProvider cache={cache}>
      <MyApp />
    </StyleProvider>,
  );

  // Grab style from cache
  const styleText = extractStyle(cache);

  // Mix with style
  return `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    ${styleText}
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">${html}</div>
  </body>
</html>
`;
};
```

### Shadow DOM Usage

Since `<style />` tag insertion is different from normal DOM in Shadow DOM scenario, you need to use `StyleProvider` of `@ant-design/cssinjs` to configure the `container` property to set the insertion position:

```tsx
import { StyleProvider } from '@ant-design/cssinjs';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const shadowRoot = someEle.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
const container = document.createElement('div');
shadowRoot.appendChild(container);
const root = createRoot(container);

root.render(
  <StyleProvider container={shadowRoot}>
    <MyApp />
  </StyleProvider>,
);
```

## FAQ

### Why component re-mounted when `theme` changed from `undefined` to some object or to `undefined`?

In ConfigProvider, we pass context through `DesignTokenContext`. When `theme` is `undefined`, a layer of Provider will not be set, so React VirtualDOM structure changes from scratch or from existence to nothing, causing components to be re-mounted. Solution: Replace `undefined` with an empty object `{}`.
