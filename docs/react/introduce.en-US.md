## Features

- Following Ant Design, a design language for creating user friendly and beautiful websites.
- It is a set of high quality UI components and based on [React Component](http://react-component.github.io/badgeboard/).
- Provides a work flow which is based on npm, webpack, and babel, supporting ES2015 and TypeScript.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install antd
```

## Usage

### Use prebuilt bundle

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from 'antd';
ReactDOM.render(<DatePicker />, mountNode);
```

And import style manually:

```jsx
import 'antd/dist/antd.css';  // or 'antd/dist/antd.less'
```

### Use modularized antd

- Use [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import) (Recommended)

   ```js
   // .babelrc
   {
     "plugins": [["import", { libraryName: "antd", style: "css" }]]
   }
   ```

   Then you can import components from antd directly.

   ```jsx
   // import js and css modularly, parsed by babel-plugin-import
   import { DatePicker } from 'antd';
   ```

- Manually import

   ```jsx
   import DatePicker from 'antd/lib/date-picker';  // just for js
   import 'antd/lib/date-picker/style/css';  // with style
   ```
