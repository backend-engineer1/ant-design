getting feedback or information purposes.
Additionally, if you need show a simple confirmation dialog, you can use `ant.Modal.confirm()`,
and so on.

#### Destroy on close

> The state of Modal will be preserved at it's component lifecircle.
> If you wish to open it with brand new state everytime, you need to reset state manually. Or simply [give a new random key](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/4165) to Modal when visible is changed to `true`, React will treat it as a new component.

> ```
> <Modal key={this.state.newRandomKey} visible={this.state.visible} />
